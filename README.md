# 🧩 Visual Code Blocks Lab project
An Visual Code, React + Tailwind CSS block-coding playground inspired by Scratch — built to demonstrate motion and looks animations, drag-and-drop coding, multiple sprite support, and a hero feature: collision-based animation swap.



🚀 Features
✅ Motion Animations

Move ___ steps

Turn ___ degrees

Go to x: ___ y: ___

Repeat animation

✅ Looks Animations

Say ___ for ___ seconds

Think ___ for ___ seconds

✅ Drag & Drop

Build scripts visually, similar to Scratch

✅ Multiple Sprites

Add, delete, and control multiple sprites

Each sprite has its own animations

✅ Play All

Play animations of all sprites together

✨ Hero Feature: Collision-Based Animation Swap

Sprites detect collision and swap animations dynamically, adding interactivity and realism

🛠 Tech Stack
React (JavaScript)

Tailwind CSS (modern responsive design & 3D-like gradients, shadows)

Custom hooks (useCollisionDetection)

📢 Hero Feature: Collision-Based Animation Swap
Before Collision

After Collision

When two sprites collide:

Their move animations automatically swap

Example: Sprite 1 moves +10 steps, Sprite 2 moves -10 steps → after collision, they switch directions

This adds life & interactivity beyond basic Scratch animations.
